# mtg-coloridentity

ðŸ¤– This README was written by GPT-4. ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This Streamlit app is designed for the multi-label classification of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards,
specifically focusing on their color identity.
It utilizes a pre-trained model hosted on Hugging Face, `joshuasundance/mtg-coloridentity-multilabel-classification`,
to predict the color identity of MTG cards based on their names and descriptions.

## Features
- Interactive UI: Users can input the name and text of any MTG card to get predictions on its color identity.
- Color Probabilities: The app displays the probability of each color identity (Black, Green, Red, Blue, White) for the given card.
- Random Card Selection: With a "Roll the Dice" feature, users can load the text of a random MTG card from the dataset.

## How It Works
The app fetches a pre-trained `SetFit` model from Hugging Face and uses it to
predict the color identities of MTG cards.
The model's predictions are displayed as a bar chart,
showing the probability of each color identity.

## Getting Started
To run this app locally, clone the repository and ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `datasets` and `setfit` from Hugging Face
